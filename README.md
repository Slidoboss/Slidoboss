Hey there.

My name is Soloudo, an experienced mobile app developer; I specialize in building cross platform applications using flutter and dart. In the near future I plan to include native IOS development in my arsenal of skills. I also occasionally build awesome games with unity and C#. In my free time I like to binge tv shows, anime and movies; play games and read business books.
